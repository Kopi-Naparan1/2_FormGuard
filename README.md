Welcome!

This site is my second project.

The purpose of this is to study and improve my CSS and JavaScript capabilities through building input fields.

Learning to make input fields is important, as almost all modern websites have this feature.

Most of the headache while building this website stems from not being able to understand how the CSS and TS work. As a result, this took many hours to build.
